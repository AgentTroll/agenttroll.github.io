        <h5 class="card-header">About Me</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">I'm a 19 year old programmer from Seattle, Washington.</p>
            <p class="card-text">I'm currently a student at Northeastern University, studying Computer
                Engineering. My future aspirations are to work on spaceflight, bringing science back to Earth and humans
                closer to the stars.</p>
            <p class="card-text">I first took an interest in programming from playing Minecraft. I started programming
                initially out of desire to recreate something like the survival games from The Hive servers. I never did
                actually get around to doing that. As a matter of fact, I've completed maybe 2 actual published
                <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/members/_ForgeUser10992836/projects">Bukkit plugins</a>. Regardless, I
                think that I've come a long way since 2013. Although programming was more or less of a side activity
                when I first started, I've realized that it's become much more than that for me.</p>

                <li class="card-text">I am a former developer at SpaceDelta. I wrote and did the majority of maintenance
                    for the species plugin. I left in September 2019 because of disagreements I had with management.

                    <a href="https://www.minesaga.org/">MineSaga</a> server network. I wrote the original minions
                    plugin, the generators plugin, the kits plugin, the gambling plugin, the original bosses plugin, and
                    worked on several other plugins that I can't even name off the top of my head. I also worked on
                    server performance, and made major modifications to the server jar to optimize the player
                    experience. I left in January 2019 to pursue my own interests, and returned in September 2019 to
                    assist development for a short time.

                    back a few months later and had great success, although I did not was not involved with it the

            <h5 class="card-title">Projects</h5>
            <ul>
                <li class="card-text"><a href="https://github.com/caojohnny/telem-filter"><code>telem-filter</code></a>
                    is a C++ program that reads SpaceX telemetry data and attempts to extract the horizontal and
                    vertical velocity measurements. The big issue with the data was deducing the velocity components
                    lead to a lot of noise in the output telemetry, which means a lot of curve fitting is generally
                    needed (ref. <code>caojohnny/liftoff</code>) in order to get good enough data. However, applying
                    what I learned in my signals class, I attempted to use a digital filter to condition the output
                    data. In the end, this lead to a shockingly good result, though somewhat inferior to curve fitting
                    due to the amount of noise still remaining.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text"><a href="https://github.com/caojohnny/gfold"><code>gfold</code></a> is a C++
                    implementation of the G-FOLD algorithm. G-FOLD is a guidance algorithm used on Mars landers and
                    SpaceX rocket boosters to find the most optimal trajectory given a set of constraints. This project
                    was a long time coming because I had difficulty finding a sufficiently good C++ library to perform
                    convex optimization. This program runs one of the numerical examples in the original G-FOLD
                    specification and plots the optimal trajectory. Unfortunately, I have yet to figure out how to
                    discretize the algorithm, so the implementation is not yet complete. That being said, it still
                    serves as a demo of the capability to implement real-time guidance computation in C++.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text"><a href="https://github.com/caojohnny/liftoff"><code>liftoff</code></a> is a C++
                    program that does much the same thing as <code>caojohnny/telem-filter</code>, but instead utilizes
                    curve fitting to condition the data rather than DSP techniques. I selected to curve fit the altitude
                    data as the majority of the issues lie with the low data resolution of the altitude telemetry. I
                    then implemented curve fitting using some bit of linear algebra to do a least-squares regression
                    forced through certain points at the edge of events such as liftoff, main engine cutoff and second
                    stage engine start. This results in very good data which does not propagate through the motion
                    derivatives modelled using a physical body toolkit written in the project.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text"><a href=https://github.com/caojohnny/bt-support""><code>landing</code></a> is an
                    Arduino project utilizing FreeRTOS to implement a basic flight computer. This program interacts with
                    <code>caojohnny/houston</code> over USB UART to simulate sensors and flight trajectory planning.
                    This project utilizes a number of techniques to reduce RAM usage and RTOS task scheduling to
                    organize several simulated components such as a flight termination systems, guidance/control and
                    telemetry downlink.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text"><a href="https://github.com/caojohnny/bt-support"><code>bt-support</code></a> is
                    a Zephyr project written in C++ to provide both bluetooth and USB UART support to an Adafruit
                    nRF52840 Feather. The bluetooth support permits uplink and downlink to Nordic UART, accessible
                    through the Bluefruit app.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text"><a href="https://github.com/caojohnny/pbft-java"><code>pbft-java</code></a> was
                    another project that has been in the works for a long time. It is a Java implementation of the
                    PBFT algorithm, which is a protocol developed to create distributed systems capable of tolerating
                    Byzantine faults. This project is split up into the client and server specification and
                    implementation modules, which provides flexibility and conformance guarantees for the design of a
                    PBFT system. PBFT is used for maintaining blockchain ledgers on multiple systems as well as for
                    replicated flight computers, such as those used by SpaceX rockets.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text"><a href="https://github.com/caojohnny/data-benchmark"><code>data-benchmark</code></a>
                    is a benchmarking suite for different methods of persisting data, written in Java. There is a lot of
                    debate over which method of data storage, between different formats of flatfile such as JSON, YAML
                    and different databases such as MySQL and SQLite. I wrote a suite to measure and gather empirical
                    evidence to inform my own decisions and design choices and decided to share it for others to benefit
                    and to write their own test suites.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text"><a href="https://github.com/caojohnny/molarmass"><code>molarmass</code></a> is a
                    Java program that determines the molar mass of a compound based on its chemical formula. This is
                    something that I am particularly proud of because it uses a state machine to parse and build a tree
                    of compound tokens. This is then parsed to obtain the molar mass of each element and their
                    quantities. In the end, I did not use this for AP Chemistry; but the fact remains that it was a
                    really elegant way to compute molar masses, at least in the programmatic sense.
